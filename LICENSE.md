## Starfield Animation
The starfield animation in this project is inspired by and adapted from Ibrahim Memon's work:
- Original source: https://github.com/ibrahimmemonn/Developer-Portfolio/blob/main/components/main/StarsBackground.tsx
- Â© Copyright 2023 Ibrahim Memon

As per the original license:
> Don't care if you fork & play with it, but you're not allowed to publish anything from it as a whole without my written permission. Also please be aware, the combination of typography, colors & layout makes up my brand identity. So please don't just clone everything, but rather do a remix!

This project uses only the starfield animation component, modified for personal portfolio use, and properly acknowledges the original creator.
